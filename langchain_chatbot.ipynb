However, there may well be alternative ways of achieving compliance with the requirements. Thus there is no obligation to adopt any particular solution contained in an Approved Document if you prefer to meet the relevant requirement in some other way.\\nOther requirements\\nThe guidance contained in an Approved Document relates only to the particular requirements of the Regulations which that document addresses. The building work will also have to comply with the requirements of any other relevant paragraphs in Schedule 1 to the Regulations.\\nThere are Approved Documents which give \\nguidance on each of the parts of Schedule 1 and on Regulation 7.\\nLIMITATION ON REQUIREMENTS', 'There are Approved Documents which give \\nguidance on each of the parts of Schedule 1 and on Regulation 7.\\nLIMITATION ON REQUIREMENTS\\nIn accordance with Regulation 8, the requirements in Part A of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations do not require anything to be done except for the purpose of securing reasonable standards of health and safety for persons in or about the buildings.MATERIALS  AND  WOR kMANSHIP\\nAny building work which is subject to the requirements imposed by Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations shall be carried out in accordance with regulation 7. Guidance on meeting these requirements on materials and workmanship is contained in Approved Document 7.\\nBuilding Regulations are made for specific', 'Building Regulations are made for specific \\npurposes, primarily the health and safety, welfare and convenience of people and for energy conservation. Standards and other technical specifications may provide relevant guidance to the extent that they relate to these considerations. However, they may also address other aspects of performance or matters which, although they relate to health and safety etc., are not covered by the Building Regulations.\\nWhen an Approved Document makes reference \\nto a named standard, the relevant version of the standard to which it refers is the one listed at the end of the publication. However, if this version has been revised or updated by the issuing standards body, the new version may be used as a source of guidance provided it continues to address the relevant requirements of the Regulations.Use of guidance A4\\nStructure  Appr oved Document AOTHER HEALTH AND SAFETY \\nLEGISLATION\\nHealth and safety regulations such as the', 'Structure  Appr oved Document AOTHER HEALTH AND SAFETY \\nLEGISLATION\\nHealth and safety regulations such as the \\nWorkplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 may impose requirements on employers and those in control of buildings used as workplaces in relation to certain physical characteristics of the workplace.\\n Ther\\ne are also \\nrequirements in health and safety law which affect building design. In particular, regulation 11 of the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2007 places duties on designers including the need to take account of the Workplace  \\n(Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 which relate to the design of, and materials used in, any structure intended for use as a workplace. \\nWhere\\n such r\\negulations  apply ther\\ne may be \\nconfusion as to whether the Building Regulations or  \\nhealth and safety  r\\nequirements take precedence, \\nas both will apply.

Where an inspector for the \\npurposes of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 has identified a contravention of such health and safety regulations they may seek to serve an improvement notice to secure compliance.  \\nIn such circumstances the inspector is prevented by virtue of Section 23(3) of the Health and Safety  \\nat Work etc. Act 1974 from requiring measures which are more onerous than necessary to comply with any requirements of the Building Regulations, unless the specific requirement of health and safety regulations are themselves more onerous.\\nOTHER FORMS OF HOUSE \\nCONSTRUCTION\\nThis Approved Document includes guidance on', 'OTHER FORMS OF HOUSE \\nCONSTRUCTION\\nThis Approved Document includes guidance on \\nstructural elements of residential buildings of traditional masonry construction. It is recognised, however, that there are other suitable forms of construction in use in the housing sector some of which (e.g. timber framed) have been in common use for a number of years and have demonstrated  \\nan adequate performance in compliance with the A1 requirement. Such alternative forms include prefabricated timber, light steel and precast concrete framed construction.\\nA number of guidance documents relating to \\nthese alternative forms are presently being developed by industry. The intention is to reference these in this Approved Document as soon as they become available and are approved by the Secretary of State.BRITISH STANDARDS', 'The British Standards Institution notified the British Standards for structural design referenced in the 2004 edition of this Approved Document as withdrawn on 31 March 2010. British Standards for structural design based upon the Eurocodes were correspondingly implemented by the British Standards Institution on 1 April 2010 and it is these standards with their UK National Annexes which are now referenced in this Approved Document as practical guidance on meeting Part A requirements.\\nThere may be alternative ways of achieving \\ncompliance with the requirements and there might be cases where it can be demonstrated that the use of withdrawn standards no longer maintained by the British Standards Institution continues to meet Part A requirements.A USE OF GUIDANCE5\\nApproved Document A  Structur eThe Requirements\\nThis Approved Document deals with the following \\nRequirements which are contained in the Building Regulations 2010.\\nRequirement  Limits on application\\nLoading', 'This Approved Document deals with the following \\nRequirements which are contained in the Building Regulations 2010.\\nRequirement  Limits on application\\nLoading\\nA1.

This includes, for example, keeping protected escape \\nroutes virtually ‘fire sterile’. \\nAppropriate fire safety design considers the way in which a building will be managed. Any reliance \\non an unrealistic or unsustainable management regime cannot be considered to have met the \\nrequirements of the regulations.\\nOnce the building is in use, the management regime should be maintained and a suitable risk \\nassessment undertaken for any variation in that regime. Failure to take proper management \\nresponsibility may result in the prosecution of an employer, building owner or occupier under \\nlegislation such as the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005.\\nProperty protection\\n0.7 The Building Regulations are intended to ensure a reasonable standard of life safety in a fire. \\nThe protection of property, including the building itself, often requires additional measures. \\nInsurers usually set higher standards before accepting the insurance risk.', 'The protection of property, including the building itself, often requires additional measures. \\nInsurers usually set higher standards before accepting the insurance risk.\\nMany insurers use the RISCAuthority Design Guide for the Fire Protection of Buildings by the  \\nFire Protection Association (FPA) as a basis for providing guidance to the building designer on what \\nthey require.Further information on the protection of property can be obtained from the FPA website: \\nwww.thefpa.co.uk.\\nInclusive design\\n0.8 The fire safety aspects of the Building Regulations aim to achieve reasonable standards of health \\nand safety for people in and around building s. \\nPeople, regardless of ability, age or gender, should be able to access building s and use their \\nfacilities.

For example, a group of specially adapted bungalows or two storey flats, with few communal \\nfacilities, will not need to be treated differently from other single storey or two storey \\ndwellinghouses or flats.\\nFire safety engineering\\n0.12 Fire safety engineering might provide an alternative approach to fire safety.
